## Tech Stack
1. **Frontend**:
   - React 18+ with TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Framer Motion for animations
   - React Router for client-side routing

2. **Tools**:
   - Vite for development server
   - ESLint + Prettier for code quality
   - Docker for containerization
   - Kubernetes manifests for deployment

3. **Design System**:
   - Custom UI components in `src/components/ui`
   - Theme variables in Tailwind config
   - Consistent dark-mode styling

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Performance**:
   - Implement React.memo for stateless components
   - Add Suspense fallbacks for all lazy-loaded routes

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Add ARIA labels to navigation elements
   - Improve color contrast ratios

3. **Features**:
   - Add dark mode toggle using `use-toast`
   - Implement analytics tracking
   - Create API integration for dynamic content

4. **Deployment**:
   - Add CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
   - Implement image optimization

Should I proceed with implementing any of these suggested improvements, or would you prefer to focus on documentation first?
